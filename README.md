# IP-connectivity-status

A basic python program that when run returns the status of listed IP addresses in `IP_addresses.txt`
- currently under development to feature a GUI consisting of tabular listing of all the said IP addresses and their status which gets periodically updated automatically, and added feature to show when a certain IP goes inactive

## How to run
- go to `/src`
- run `main.py`
<!-- - the status of the given IP addresses will be returned on stdout with the convention of <br> -->
<!-- Hostname | IP Address | Status | Avg Latency | %Packets lost -->
- the status of the given IP addresses will be displayed on a table window
